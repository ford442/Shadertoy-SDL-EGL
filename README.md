# Shadertoy WASM


An OpenGLES, WebAssembly based web shader loader PWA.

Shadertoy WASM uses Javascript to read from a randomly selected Shadertoy compatible GLSL program. Also creates an EGL context for image enhancing effects.

INSTALLING AND USING

If you want to set up your own Shadertoy WASM you can begin by cloning this repository to run the Makefiles on one of the branches or there is a Release zip downloadable to run a copy by webserver right away.

FURTHER DELELOPMENT

I plan to add BPM (beats per minute) tempo detection using Aubio library so that the shaders can be arutomatically synchronized with music. Eventually I hope to incorporate a WebAssembly build of the ProjectM music visualizer.
